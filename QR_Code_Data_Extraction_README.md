## Overview
QR-Code-Data-Extraction is an advanced, Python-based solution for extracting information from QR codes. This project aims to simplify and automate the process of reading and processing data embedded in QR codes, which are increasingly used in various sectors like retail, logistics, and event management.

## Features
- **Efficient QR Code Detection**: Utilizes robust algorithms to detect QR codes in images and PDFs quickly.
- **Support for Multiple File Formats**: Works with popular image formats such as JPG, PNG, BMP, and PDF.
- **High Accuracy**: Ensures precise data extraction even from QR codes in challenging conditions.
- **Batch Processing**: Capable of processing multiple QR codes from different images simultaneously.
- **Customizable Output**: Offers options to customize the format of the extracted data.
- **FTP Support**: The program can connect to an FTP server to retrieve and process files.
- **Database Integration**: The program can connect to a PostgreSQL database to store processed file information.
- **Error Reporting**: The program can send an email notification if an error occurs during processing.
